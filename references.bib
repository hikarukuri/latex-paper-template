	abstract = {From bird flocks to fish schools, animal groups often seem to react to environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in collective animal behavior have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may emerge from simple behavioral rules. Less effort has been devoted to understanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a whole reacts to its environment. Yet, in the presence of strong predatory pressure on the group, collective response may yield a significant adaptive advantage. Here we suggest that collective response in animal groups may be achieved through scale-free behavioral correlations. By reconstructing the 3D position and velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each other. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a constant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result indicates that behavioral correlations are scale free: The change in the behavioral state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other animals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations provide each animal with an effective perception range much larger than the direct interindividual interaction range, thus enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest that flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to environmental perturbations.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to solve certain computational problems much faster than classical computers. However, current quantum processors are limited by their modest size and appreciable error rates. Recent efforts to demonstrate quantum speedups have therefore focused on problems that are both classically hard and naturally suited to current quantum hardware, such as sampling from complicated—although not explicitly useful—probability distributions1–3. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a quantum algorithm that is similarly well suited to current hardware, but which samples from complicated distributions arising in several applications. The algorithm performs Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a prominent iterative technique4, to sample from the Boltzmann distribution of classical Ising models. Unlike most near-term quantum algorithms, ours provably converges to the correct distribution, despite being hard to simulate classically. But like most MCMC algorithms, its convergence rate is difficult to establish theoretically, so we instead analysed it through both experiments and simulations. In experiments, our quantum algorithm converged in fewer iterations than common classical MCMC alternatives, suggesting unusual robustness to noise. In simulations, we observed a polynomial speedup between cubic and quartic over such alternatives. This empirical speedup, should it persist to larger scales, could ease computational bottlenecks posed by this sampling problem in machine learning5, statistical physics6 and optimization7. This algorithm therefore opens a new path for quantum computers to solve useful—not merely difficult—sampling problems.},

	abstract = {Thin sheets can be assembled into origami tubes to create a variety of deployable, reconfigurable and mechanistically unique three-dimensional structures. We introduce and explore origami tubes with polygonal, translational symmetric cross-sections that can reconfigure into numerous geometries. The tubular structures satisfy the mathematical definitions for flat and rigid foldability, meaning that they can fully unfold from a flattened state with deformations occurring only at the fold lines. The tubes do not need to be straight and can be constructed to follow a non-linear curved line when deployed.
              The cross-section and kinematics of the tubular structures can be reprogrammed by changing the direction of folding at some folds.
              We discuss the variety of tubular structures that can be conceived and we show limitations that govern the geometric design. We quantify the global stiffness of the origami tubes through eigenvalue and structural analyses and highlight the mechanical characteristics of these systems. The two-scale nature of this work indicates that, from a local viewpoint, the cross-sections of the polygonal tubes are reconfigurable while, from a global viewpoint, deployable tubes of desired shapes are achieved. This class of tubes has potential applications ranging from pipes and micro-robotics to deployable architecture in buildings.},

As the bellows unfold, the volume of the origami structure will change significantly, offering potential for use as inflatable deployable structures. This paper presents a geometric study of the volume of multi-stable Miura-ori and Kresling bellows, focusing on their application as deployable space habitats. Such habitats would be compactly stowed during launch, before expanding once in orbit. The internal volume ratio between different deployed states is investigated across the geometric design space. As a case study, the SpaceX Falcon 9 payload fairing is chosen for the transportation of space habitats. The stowed volume and effective deployed volume of the origami space habitats are calculated to enable comparison with conventional habitat designs. Optimal designs for the deployment of Miura-ori and Kresling patterned tubular space habitats are obtained using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques. Configurations with significant volume expansion can be found in both patterns, with the Miura-ori patterns achieving higher volume expansion due to their additional radial deployment. A multi-objective PSO (MOPSO) is adopted to identify trade-offs between volumetric deployment and radial expansion ratios for the Miura-ori pattern.},

The classical solutions, such as triangles, squares, and hexagons in the plane and cubes and other polyhedra in three-dimensional space are built with sharp corners and flat faces. However, many tilings in Nature are characterized by shapes with curved edges, nonflat faces, and few, if any, sharp corners. An important question is then to relate prototypical sharp tilings to softer natural shapes. Here, we solve this problem by introducing a new class of shapes, the soft cells, minimizing the number of sharp corners and filling space as soft tilings. We prove that an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into soft tilings and we construct the soft versions of all Dirichlet–Voronoi cells associated with point lattices in two and three dimensions. Remarkably, these ideal soft shapes, born out of geometry, are found abundantly in nature, from cells to shells.},

	abstract = {We consider several quadrilateral origami tilings, including the Miura-ori crease pattern, allowing for crease-reversal defects above the ground state which maintain local flat foldability. Using exactly solvable models, we show that these origami tilings can have phase transitions as a function of crease state variables, as a function of the arrangement of creases around vertices, and as a function of local layer orderings of neighboring faces. We use the exactly solved cases of the staggered odd eight-vertex model as well as Baxter's exactly solved three-coloring problem on the square lattice to study these origami tilings. By treating the crease-reversal defects as a lattice gas, we find exact analytic expressions for their density, which is directly related to the origami material's elastic modulus. The density and phase transition analysis has implications for the use of these origami tilings as tunable metamaterials; our analysis shows that Miura-ori's density is more tunable than Barreto's Mars density, for example. We also find that there is a broader range of tunability as a function of the density of layering defects compared to as a function of the density of crease order defects before the phase transition point is reached; material and mechanical properties that depend on local layer ordering properties will have a greater amount of tunability. The defect density of Barreto's Mars, on the other hand, can be increased until saturation without passing through a phase transition point. We further consider relaxing the requirement of local flat foldability by mapping to a solvable case of the 16-vertex model, demonstrating a different phase transition point for this case.},

By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

	abstract = {Birds change the shape and area of their wings to an exceptional degree, surpassing insects, bats and aircraft in their ability to morph their wings for a variety of tasks. This morphing is governed by a musculoskeletal system, which couples elbow and wrist motion. Since the discovery of this effect in 1839, the planar ‘drawing parallels’ mechanism has been used to explain the coupling. Remarkably, this mechanism has never been corroborated from quantitative motion data. Therefore, we measured how the wing skeleton of a pigeon (Columba livia) moves during morphing. Despite earlier planar assumptions, we found that the skeletal motion paths are highly three-dimensional and do not lie in the anatomical plane, ruling out the ‘drawing parallels’ mechanism. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography scans in seven consecutive poses show how the two wrist bones contribute to morphing, particularly the sliding ulnare. From these data, we infer the joint types for all six bones that form the wing morphing mechanism and corroborate the most parsimonious mechanism based on least-squares error minimization. Remarkably, the algorithm shows that all optimal four-bar mechanisms either lock, are unable to track the highly three-dimensional bone motion paths, or require the radius and ulna to cross for accuracy, which is anatomically unrealistic. In contrast, the algorithm finds that a six-bar mechanism recreates the measured motion accurately with a parallel radius and ulna and a sliding ulnare. This revises our mechanistic understanding of how birds morph their wings, and offers quantitative inspiration for engineering morphing wings.},

	abstract = {Ladybird beetles are high-mobility insects and explore broad areas by switching between walking and flying. Their excellent wing transformation systems enabling this lifestyle are expected to provide large potential for engineering applications. However, the mechanism behind the folding of their hindwings remains unclear. The reason is that ladybird beetles close the elytra ahead of wing folding, preventing the observation of detailed processes occurring under the elytra. In the present study, artificial transparent elytra were transplanted on living ladybird beetles, thereby enabling us to observe the detailed wing-folding processes. The result revealed that in addition to the abdominal movements mentioned in previous studies, the edge and ventral surface of the elytra, as well as characteristic shaped veins, play important roles in wing folding. The structures of the wing frames enabling this folding process and detailed 3D shape of the hindwing were investigated using microcomputed tomography. The results showed that the tape spring-like elastic frame plays an important role in the wing transformation mechanism. Compared with other beetles, hindwings in ladybird beetles are characterized by two seemingly incompatible properties: (i) the wing rigidity with relatively thick veins and (ii) the compactness in stored shapes with complex crease patterns. The detailed wing-folding process revealed in this study is expected to facilitate understanding of the naturally optimized system in this excellent deployable structure.},

Here we program discs to deform into stably falling parachutes as they deploy under fluid–structure interaction. Parachutes are expensive and delicate to manufacture, which limits their use for humanitarian airdrops or drone delivery. Laser cutting a closed-loop kirigami pattern18 in a disc induces porosity and flexibility into an easily fabricated parachute. By performing wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations using a custom flow-induced reconfiguration model19, we develop a design tool to realize kirigami-inspired parachutes. Guided by these results, we fabricate parachutes from the centimetre to the metre scale and test them in realistic conditions. We show that at low load-to-area ratios, kirigami-inspired parachutes exhibit a comparable terminal velocity to conventional ones. However, unlike conventional parachutes that require a gliding angle for vertical stability20 and fall at random far from a target, our kirigami-inspired parachutes always fall near the target, regardless of their initial release angle. These kinds of parachutes could limit material losses during airdropping as well as decrease manufacturing costs and complexity.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Origami, the ancient art of folding paper, has recently emerged as a method for creating deployable and reconfigurable engineering systems. These systems tend to be flexible because the thin sheets bend and twist easily. We introduce a new method of assembling origami into coupled tubes that can increase the origami stiffness by two orders of magnitude. The new assemblages can deploy through a single flexible motion, but they are substantially stiffer for any other type of bending or twisting movement. This versatility can be used for deployable structures in robotics, aerospace, and architecture. On a smaller scale, assembling thin sheets into these tubular assemblages can create metamaterials that can be deployed, stiffened, and tuned.
          , 
            Thin sheets have long been known to experience an increase in stiffness when they are bent, buckled, or assembled into smaller interlocking structures. We introduce a unique orientation for coupling rigidly foldable origami tubes in a “zipper” fashion that substantially increases the system stiffness and permits only one flexible deformation mode through which the structure can deploy. The flexible deployment of the tubular structures is permitted by localized bending of the origami along prescribed fold lines. All other deformation modes, such as global bending and twisting of the structural system, are substantially stiffer because the tubular assemblages are overconstrained and the thin sheets become engaged in tension and compression. The zipper-coupled tubes yield an unusually large eigenvalue bandgap that represents the unique difference in stiffness between deformation modes. Furthermore, we couple compatible origami tubes into a variety of cellular assemblages that can enhance mechanical characteristics and geometric versatility, leading to a potential design paradigm for structures and metamaterials that can be deployed, stiffened, and tuned. The enhanced mechanical properties, versatility, and adaptivity of these thin sheet systems can provide practical solutions of varying geometric scales in science and engineering.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a computational design method to obtain collapsible variations of rigid-foldable surfaces, i.e., continuously and ﬁnitely transformable polyhedral surfaces, homeomorphic to disks and cylinders. Two novel techniques are proposed to design such surfaces: a technique for obtaining a freeform variation of a rigid-foldable and bidirectionally ﬂat-foldable disk surface, which is a hybrid of generalized Miura-ori and eggbox patterns, and a technique to generalize the geometry of cylindrical surface using bidirectionally ﬂat-foldable planar quadrilateral mesh by introducing additional constraints to keep the topology maintained throughout the continuous transformation. Proposed methods produce freeform variations of rigid-foldable structures that have not been realized thus far. Such a structure forms a one-DOF mechanism with two possible ﬂat states. This enables the designs of deployable structures useful for packaging the boundary of architectural spaces, space structures, and so on.},

However, it is known that the developable double corrugation surface, called Miura-ori, produces a rigid deployment mechanism. The rigid-foldability of Miura-ori is due to the singularity in its pattern, where a single vertex is repeated. We generalize the geometric condition for enabling rigid motion in general quadrilateral mesh origami without the trivial repeating symmetry. To ensure the existence of a ﬁnite motion, we derive the identity of functions from the formula for degree-4 single-vertex origami. This yields a variety of unexplored generalized shapes of quadrilateral mesh origami that preserve ﬁnite rigid-foldability in addition to developability and ﬂat-foldability.},
